                    <p>George Orwell wrote “1984”. The author described an apocalyptic society but, nevertheless, something unexpected was about to happen that year. And thus, Paulo Lemos was born.
                    </p>
                    <p>Because of his inclination towards suffering, three were destined to happen: a do-it-yourself musical career in punk rock, a passion for Russian literature and the desire to program.
                    </p>
                    <p>Even though Paulo has studied Journalism, the fact is that this career was never meant to be. Because of this, he has worked around the globe and travelled quite a bit: always searching for something that would fulfill his dreams and passion.
                    </p>
                    <p>Hence, in 2020 <Academia de Código_> appeared in his life and, therefore, a wild but brave decision was taken.
                    </p>
                    <p>He would leave South America, after living there for 6 years, and would return to his Azorean motherland in order to be a Junior Full Stack Developer.
                    </p>
                    <p>In 2021, after taking <A/C_> bootcamp, he was one step closer to achieving his dream and, consequently, his nihilistic Sartre’s existentialism perspective on life disappeared.
                    </p>
                    <p>And now, the big challenge appeared and we shall code together the next chapter of Paulo’s book of life. And this will happen at Bring Global company.</p>
